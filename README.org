This colorscheme is based off of the mountaineer.vim Vim theme - an amazing theme in its own right, but it felt incomplete to me in some respects (and too harsh in others), so now Mountain exists, I guess. Mountain has been expanded off mountaineer, and I've spent a long time making themes based on my own preferences, so here we are.

Much of the original source code for these themes were derived from [[https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme][dracula theme]] - it's a great colorscheme, and it's what I originally migrated from.
